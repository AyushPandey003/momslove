Important: You need to create the following icon files for PWA functionality:

1. icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-384x384.png (384x384 pixels)
3. icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor or generate them from your logo using online tools like:
- https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/
- https://maskable.app/editor
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/

For the best experience, make sure icons are:
- Clear even at small sizes
- Have proper padding (especially for maskable icons)
- Use the same design across all sizes
- Include your brand colors

Also, create an offline-image.png (800x600) to be shown when images fail to load in offline mode.
